# Formal meetings

## Description

The term “formal meetings” is applied in this context as an umbrella
term for a variety of meetings that have a higher level of formality
than team or project management meetings. They usually involve senior
leaders of the organization, either to convey information/decisions
(e.g. townhall) or a mandate from senior leadership (e.g. campus
committee that is tasked with recommendations). These meetings can
also involve external institutions or contacts, networks, associations
or consortia. Participants in these types of meetings may include
senior-level/leadership representatives from campus units or external
institutions, which may require additional protocol and consideration
of hierarchy/position. Sometimes these meetings involve larger numbers
of participants than other meetings, including both senior-level
participants and individuals who are staffing them.
