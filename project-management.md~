# Project management meetings

## Description


Project management is a time-bound process of planning, implementing and evaluating a project from start to finish. Recurrent project management meetings are an essential part of the process. Recurrent team meetings keep the project moving forward, ensure timely and accountable completion of each task, and steward the project from initial ideas to successful completion.
