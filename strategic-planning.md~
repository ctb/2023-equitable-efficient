# Strategic planning meetings

## Description

Strategic planning meetings are an important part of the strategic
planning process for organizations or units within
organizations. Strategic planning meetings can create a space for
information sharing, in-depth discussions and creative thinking about
mission, vision, goals, objectives and actions which will guide the
organization or unit for the future. Strategic planning meetings are
an essential way to create inclusiveness in the strategic planning
process and ensure that the final plan is viewed as relevant and
valuable to all members of the staff. Strategic plan meetings can be
organized in various configurations, depending on the number of
participants who will be involved in planning and the expected final
output (structure and parameters of the strategic plan). Strategic
planning meetings may involve larger committees and smaller
subcommittees or working groups, depending on the size of the
organization or unit and the elements of the strategic planning
effort.
