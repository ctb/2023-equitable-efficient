### Laying the groundwork


* Choose a limited group size (5-10)

### Pre-meeting checklist

* Prepare participants for brainstorming by providing prompts and defining scope of brainstorming
* Prompt as “even better yet/yes and”
* Provide a few starting ideas or indicators of ideas without providing too much structure; alternatively, provide questions
* Choose one or more scribes
* Lay out what tools, if any, will be used (google doc? whiteboard? mentimeter? post it notes? breakout rooms?)
* Lay out potential next steps including who will make decisions about brainstorming/move into refinement.

### In-meeting items

* Actively facilitate people’s contributions and stop people from shutting down others while also keeping on track
* Let scribe monitor conversation
* Display brainstorming/notes document

### Post-meeting items

* Thank everyone
* Provide details on next steps now that brainstorming is concluded: more brainstorming? refinement?
