# Equitable and Efficient Collaborations

This is boilerplate text about the importance of making collaborations
equitable and efficient by adopting good practices in meetings. We could
add lots of text here!

## Meeting types

[Formal meetings](formal-meetings.md) - meetings with a higher level of formality than most meetings!

[Project management meetings](project-management.md) - regular meetings for managing a project from start to finish.
