# Equitable and Efficient Collaborations

## Introduction

We've all experienced bad meetings. These can be due to a lack of
planning, disorganization, unclear objectives, weak moderation,
difficult interpersonal dynamics, and a variety of other issues.

For better or worse, meetings are one of the main mechanisms we use in
our workplaces to share, plan, organize and move forward on
initiatives. Meetings are a necessary part of collaborative work.

We can make them better!

The purpose of this toolkit is to support improved collaboration
through efficient and equitable meetings. This toolkit was written to
serve as a handy resource to save time, increase efficiency and
promote equitable and inclusive spaces for collective thinking and
action.

We cannot provide easy solutions to all meeting challenges, but this
resource is designed to help smooth some of the bumps in the road. We
have identified some of the recurrent challenges with meetings and
also collected some of the good practices that can help you out to
save time and achieve your objectives.

This toolkit includes guidance for four categories of meetings: 

* Formal meetings
* Project management meetings
* Brainstorming meetings
* Strategic planning meetings

### Efficiency

Meetings require time, from both organizers and the participants - and
sometimes are not necessary to accomplish objectives! Making the best
use of meetings requires planning and clarity in purpose and process.
Before scheduling any meeting, facilitators should evaluate whether
the objectives can be accomplished through alternative means, such as
email, collaborative documents, or a brief one-on-one discussions.

Meetings require time, from both organizers and the
participants. Making the best use of that time requires planning and
clarity in purpose and process. It is important that meetings have
defined goals/objectives, hold space for sufficient discussion and
inclusive participation, facilitate actions through roles and
responsibilities, and support accountability for next steps. For
efficient meetings, it is critical to think through and structure the
steps â€“ pre-meeting, during meeting and post-meeting.

### Equity

Meetings can reflect collective values, and it is important to
recognize some of the dynamics that can affect equity. Meetings can
reinforce hierarchies, both explicitly and implicitly. Meetings can
also be overtaken by seniority or dominant personalities and views,
closing the space for out of the box thinking or minority
perspectives. An important first step is to keep equity considerations
in mind in planning and executing all types of meetings. Meetings, and
the pre- and post-planning, can be structured to mitigate some of
these issues through such approaches as open and consistent
information sharing; synchronous and asynchronous collaboration
mechanisms, personal outreach, and acknowledging and validating
different learning and communication styles within the group. This is
hard work, but creating more productive and enjoyable collaboration
spaces is worth the effort and ensures that we are putting equity
principles into action.

## Meeting types

[Formal meetings](formal-meetings.md) - meetings with a higher level
of formality than most meetings!

[Project management meetings](project-management.md) - regular
meetings for managing a project from start to finish.

[Brainstorming meeting](brainstorming.md) - small group meeting to
generate ideas, to problem solve, and think creatively.

[Strategic planning meetings](strategic-planning.md) - meetings to create or contribute to strategic planning processes.
