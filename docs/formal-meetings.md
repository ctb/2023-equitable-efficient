# Formal meetings

## Description

"Formal meeting" is an umbrella term for a variety of meetings that
have a higher level of formality than team or project management
meetings. They usually involve senior leaders of the organization,
either to convey information/decisions (e.g. townhall) or a mandate
from senior leadership (e.g. campus committee that is tasked with
recommendations). These meetings can also involve external
institutions or contacts, networks, associations or
consortia. Participants in these types of meetings may include
senior-level/leadership representatives from campus units or external
institutions, which may require additional protocol and consideration
of hierarchy/position. Sometimes these meetings involve larger numbers
of participants than other meetings, including both senior-level
participants and individuals who are staffing them.
