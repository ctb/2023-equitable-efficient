# Project management meetings

## Description


Project management is a time-bound process of planning, implementing and evaluating a project from start to finish. Recurrent project management meetings are an essential part of the process. Recurrent team meetings keep the project moving forward, ensure timely and accountable completion of each task, and steward the project from initial ideas to successful completion.
 

## Facilitator Considerations

### Pre-meeting

* Project manager/lead should offer a clear articulation of the project, its objectives and expected outcomes.(Project manager does not need to be the same person as facilitator). Develop or obtain a timeline for the project with deadlines and outputs at different stages of the project to guide your meeting scheduling.
* Determine team members who need to participate in the recurrent program management meetings. Note their portfolios/expertise and connection to specific elements of the project.

### First Meeting

* Schedule a project kick-off meeting. In preparation, gather any relevant background documents (e.g. organizational guidance, plans, policies, project ideas, etc.) that members of the team will need. 
* At the project kickoff meeting, provide an overview of the project, timeline, and clarify roles and responsibilities for each member of the team. Ensure scope of the project is discussed sufficiently so that there is common understanding. Establish expectations for the time commitment from each team member. Gather ideas and suggestions for process from the team members. Note any concerns. Acknowledge the value of each team membersâ€™ experience with their portfolios and past projects to inform the process.
* As a team, decide on frequency, duration, and mode (virtual/in-person) for the recurrent project management meetings. 

### Recurrent meetings

* Schedule project management meetings in advance for the duration of the project if possible, indicating deadlines for deliverables, as relevant. Establish an option for subgroups to meet in between, as needed.
* Identify a timekeeper and a notetaker. May need to rotate these roles if these are also active team members.
* Prepare a focused agenda for each meeting and send in advance. Articulate the stage of the project, and the objectives and also desired outcomes for discussion segments. Assign timing to each section of the agenda. Designate each member of the team/unit in the agenda as providing an update on the area of responsibility. Include a section of the agenda and sufficient time to determine action items and the team member who will be responsible for each action item.
* Consider a rolling agenda and notes document with most recent at the top/relevant links.Include upcoming meeting agenda at top, clearly titled with meeting information. 
* Encourage group monitoring/groundskeeping of agenda/notes document; note taker has primary responsibility for capturing things, but everyone can and should help make sure ideas are captured. Label ideas by discussant names, as relevant. (See Brainstorming Meeting for additional ideas for project management meetings that require a brainstorming component.)
* Establish a place to access shared documents/provide edits and revisions to in-process documents by the team (e.g. Box; Google (note: clearly name); shared drive). A spreadsheet or project management software can be helpful to manage tasks and responsibilities, and completion dates in between meetings.
* Send pre-meeting reminders (~24 hours advance) and post-meeting summaries (within 1 hour ideally for key action points/more detailed notes can be added later).Include agenda document link in e-mail, along with time of next meeting.
* Provide a process whereby ad hoc breakout groups can be formed to dive into items that need more discussion, and place report-backs on next agenda.

### Post-meeting

* It can be valuable to include one final project management meeting after the project is completed to evaluate the process, successes and challenges, and lessons learned for future projects.

### Checklists

??? note "checklists"

    - [ ] What is the objective? Well-defined project scope, timeline, and outputs.
    - [ ] Who needs to be at the table? Identify the project management team.
    - [ ] What background information do team members need to know? Supply relevant materials in advance of the first meeting.
    - [ ] Is everyone on the same page about project scope, expected commitment and process steps? Kick off meeting to set the parameters, process, tone.
    - [ ] Are meetings scheduled through the duration of the project? Ad hoc meetings can be added but project management meetings should be scheduled as far in advance as possible.
    - [ ] Are roles and responsibilities of the team members defined? Each member should know what they are bringing to the process and the pieces that they are expected to lead.
    - [ ] Do team members know the desired outcomes for each meeting and their own action items? Focused agenda with designated timing and sections and adequate time for action item discussion.
    - [ ] Do team members know where to easily access documents and add ideas/updates? A shared place for agendas, notes and deliverable drafts is essential for progress in between meetings.
    - [ ] Is each team member moving forward on action items? Reminders, reminders, reminders!
