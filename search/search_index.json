These can be due to a lack of planning, disorganization, unclear objectives, weak moderation, difficult interpersonal dynamics, and a variety of other issues. For better or worse, meetings are one of the main mechanisms we use in our workplaces to share, plan, organize and move forward on initiatives. Meetings are a necessary part of collaborative work. We can make them better! The purpose of this toolkit is to support improved collaboration through efficient and equitable meetings. This toolkit was written to serve as a handy resource to save time, increase efficiency and promote equitable and inclusive spaces for collective thinking and action. We cannot provide easy solutions to all meeting challenges, but this resource is designed to help smooth some of the bumps in the road. We have identified some of the recurrent challenges with meetings and also collected some of the good practices that can help you out to save time and achieve your objectives. This toolkit includes guidance for four categories of meetings: Formal meetings Project management meetings Brainstorming meetings Strategic planning meetings Efficiency Meetings require time, from both organizers and the participants - and sometimes are not necessary to accomplish objectives! Making the best use of meetings requires planning and clarity in purpose and process. Before scheduling any meeting, facilitators should evaluate whether the objectives can be accomplished through alternative means, such as email, collaborative documents, or a brief one-on-one discussions. Meetings require time, from both organizers and the participants. Making the best use of that time requires planning and clarity in purpose and process. It is important that meetings have defined goals/objectives, hold space for sufficient discussion and inclusive participation, facilitate actions through roles and responsibilities, and support accountability for next steps. For efficient meetings, it is critical to think through and structure the steps \u2013 pre-meeting, during meeting and post-meeting. Equity Meetings can reflect collective values, and it is important to recognize some of the dynamics that can affect equity. Meetings can reinforce hierarchies, both explicitly and implicitly. Meetings can also be overtaken by seniority or dominant personalities and views, closing the space for out of the box thinking or minority perspectives. An important first step is to keep equity considerations in mind in planning and executing all types of meetings. Meetings, and the pre- and post-planning, can be structured to mitigate some of these issues through such approaches as open and consistent information sharing; synchronous and asynchronous collaboration mechanisms, personal outreach, and acknowledging and validating different learning and communication styles within the group. This is hard work, but creating more productive and enjoyable collaboration spaces is worth the effort and ensures that we are putting equity principles into action. Meeting types Formal meetings - meetings with a higher level of formality than most meetings! Project management meetings - regular meetings for managing a project from start to finish. Brainstorming meeting - small group meeting to generate ideas, to problem solve, and think creatively. Strategic planning meetings - meetings to create or contribute to strategic planning processes.","title":"Equitable and Efficient Collaborations"},{"location":"#equitable-and-efficient-collaborations","text":"","title":"Equitable and Efficient Collaborations"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"We've all experienced bad meetings.
