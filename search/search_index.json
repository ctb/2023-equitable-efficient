They usually involve senior leaders of the organization, either to convey information/decisions (e.g. townhall) or a mandate from senior leadership (e.g. campus committee that is tasked with recommendations). These meetings can also involve external institutions or contacts, networks, associations or consortia. Participants in these types of meetings may include senior-level/leadership representatives from campus units or external institutions, which may require additional protocol and consideration of hierarchy/position. Sometimes these meetings involve larger numbers of participants than other meetings, including both senior-level participants and individuals who are staffing them. Facilitator Considerations Pre-meeting Extensive pre-planning is the key to successful formal meetings! A chair should be identified prior to the first formal meeting. The chair should be of a level and skill set to be able to preside over the group and keep the group moving towards the expected outcomes. At least one staff member should be identified to support the efforts. Purpose/objectives need to be well-defined, whether this is a single meeting or there is a series of formal meetings that will occur over a period of time (e.g. committees).If the formal meeting(s) are a result of a leadership directive, then the mandate/expected deliverable(s) should be documented in writing for all participants. Invitations to participants should be more formal than a working meeting. In some cases, this may require a letter from leadership. Often, it takes time to determine appropriate invitees (considering the level of other participants and representation from relevant units, for example). An agenda that is distributed in advance is required for formal meetings. The agenda should include all needed logistical information, as well as defined topics, times, and speakers.Formal meetings have a tendency to allocate the majority of time to updates and insufficient time for dialogue. .It is often a struggle to incorporate multiple and/or conflicting views in these types of meetings. The agenda may be constructed to allow for guided discussion or break out groups to draw out diverse viewpoints. It is important to acknowledge and factor in organizational hierarchies when constructing these meetings, especially in terms of speakers and discussion segments. Discussion segments are affected by these dynamics (described below). It is not always feasible, but it is ideal to ensure that speakers represent a range of views and levels (if possible). Ensure there is a plan for documenting the discussion. The staff member who is supporting the process can oversee, and it might be appropriate to include a student/intern/junior level staff member to take notes as it is good professional experience. The chair should be fully briefed ahead of time in terms of the meeting objectives and agenda. Meeting Formal meetings often have a unique dynamic due to implicit and explicit hierarchies and senior-level participants. It is important to recognize that hierarchies can silence participants or minimize views of those with less power and influence.There is no simple solution to this problem, except to try to build in opportunities for broader participation and discussion, in the meeting or between meetings (which often works better for less vocal/more junior participants). Additional mechanisms for input outside of formal meetings may be important to hear input from all participants (e.g. personalized outreach through email; google docs/jamboard/Miro or other platforms). These meetings may serve to identify more contentious or debated issues but may not be the fora to solve them. Often, identifying the issues that need further attention can be useful and integrated into brainstorming, project management or other implementation phases if they cannot be fully addressed in the formal meeting space. Identifying the key issues in the formal meetings is a valuable contribution to larger processes. The chair should be willing to adjust, pivot or re-frame the questions if the formal group appears stuck. Post-meeting Follow up in between meetings and at the end of the process (e.g. time bound committees) is very important. When there is a lack of communication, participants may lose interest or disengage. Beware of back room decisions (major decisions). Tensions can emerge if there are significant decisions or actions that are taken on behalf of the full group without appropriate consultation with all the participants in the process. However, it is appropriate to come up with draft options or proposals for the full group, based on discussions at the meetings. This helps draw strands of conversations together and move the group forward. Too many options can be challenging for reaching consensus with larger groups in formal meetings so keep it focused. An \u201copen door\u201d for participants is important - either with the chair or the staff person - to ensure that there is an informal vehicle for feedback throughout the process. It is impossible to make everyone happy, but transparency and availability are very helpful. Checklists checklist for foo make your fiz do your baz (Nothing here yet) Resources Setting up for Success: If the group will need to meet and work together over a period of time, it is important to articulate roles, expectations, and principles of engagement in the first meeting. This could include: Reviewing a formal charge for a committee from leadership. Discussing the final deliverables, the process, and how the group will approach exchange of ideas and decision-making. Reviewing other goals, objectives, timeframe and deliverables as set out by leadership/committee chair(s), etc. Discussing administrative needs (note taking; IT issues especially if virtual; agenda preparation; email communications, etc.) and which individuals will handle or bring in additional personnel to support the efforts. Check names and titles for corrections. Discussing establishing the culture and norms for the group, including how to promote inclusivity and openness, manage productive disagreement, and fully benefit from diverse perspectives and ideas. Deciding how participants can make interventions at different points in the process (verbally in meetings, responding to follow up emails, other mechanisms), recognizing power dynamics and different ways in which individuals think, respond, and creatively problem-solve. Determining if final consensus is needed and in what areas. Deciding if the final deliverable(s) can present or accommodate different approaches and recommendations or need to present one unified decision/path. Decide if an additional governance structure/process is necessary (this might be helpful if the group is very large, or includes multiple institutions, for example). Administrative Tasks: Establish a meeting schedule, in consultation with participants to find acceptable times and to determine frequency for meetings. Set as many meetings as possible at the beginning of the process (e.g. schedule monthly meetings for six months at a time). Determine with the group if the meetings should be in-person, virtual, hybrid. Virtual option is useful to offer as the can be recorded (if desired and agreed by the group). Prepare read-aheads prior to each meeting. This includes formal agenda (ideally with time allocations for each segment and lead moderator if it is not always the chair). This also includes meeting notes from the previous meeting and any updates that can be communicated without taking meeting time. Depending on the topic, this may also include relevant policies, articles, and other resources that can inform the discussions. Designate a note-taker and document attendance, discussion, ideas and action points. Share prior to the next meeting. If there are action points that need to be implemented sooner, send out meeting notes with those follow up items as soon as possible with deadlines and clarity on who is responsible for what. Highlight any actions that participants must do in the body of the follow up email in a visible manner, as many will not open attachments or review meeting notes. Making the Meetings Work for Everyone: Consider designating other speakers besides the chair(s) for various parts of the agenda in each meeting. Offer the opportunity to everyone at some point in the process. *Be sensitive to cultural differences if you are working with a group of individuals from different regions of the world. This may also affect who speaks in meetings, and when and how action points are addressed. If English is the second language for some participants, speak slowly; also enable closed captioning, take notes. Formulate guiding questions for discussions to keep the conversation moving and focus the group on key themes or issues that need to be considered from different points of view. Allocate extra time for discussion and utilize breakout groups in Zoom if the meeting is virtual. Make a continuous effort to invite junior level participants or others who may not have as much institutional influence to speak and/or acknowledge and elevate their ideas. Promoting Communication and Transparency: Formal groups and meetings that continue over a period of time usually benefit from smaller/informal subgroups and individual outreach to supplement the formal meetings. This can be very important if there are complex topics that need deeper-dive discussions and recommendations. It can also ensure that chair(s)/organizers hear all perspectives. Subgroups may or may not need leaders/chairs. If the subgroups are quite small, designating a lead my not be necessary, but it will be important for a representative from the subgroup to report to the chair(s)/organizers regularly and share ideas from the sub-group for broader discussion in the formal meetings. Formal processes also benefit from opportunities for informal discussions, where participants may more freely share their views. Smaller discussion groups can also promote relationships that improve the efficiency of the work and promote the ability to reach consensus at different points in the process. Committee chair(s)/organizers should also monitor engagement closely and reach out individually, as necessary, to participants to encourage input. This is not always feasible on a regular basis, but individual outreach at key junctures can significantly increase responsiveness and ideas from those who are not participating actively in meetings or follow up actions. Shared documents can also be a mechanism for input in between meetings and to provide an additional brainstorming space. Offering different ways to contribute can ensure that the process is benefiting from different strengths, schedules and preferences for idea generation. Note that final deliverables should always have a lead author to support consistency and clarity, which is very hard to achieve with multiple writing styles.","title":"Formal meetings"},{"location":"formal-meetings/#formal-meetings","text":"","title":"Formal meetings"},{"location":"formal-meetings/#description","text":"The term \u201cformal meetings\u201d is applied in this context as an umbrella term for a variety of meetings that have a higher level of formality than team or project management meetings.
